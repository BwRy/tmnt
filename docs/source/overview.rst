What is TMNT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TMNT (Topic Modeling Neural Toolkit) implements a number of methods for
training and applying neural network variational autoencoders (VAEs) to the problem of
modeling latent topics in large documents collections. While various open source implementations
of some of the algorithms in these recent papers are available, TMNT strives to include
the best variations across the literature within a software package that is quick to use and
deploy for applications.

A few highlights include:

* Use of von Mises Fisher hyperspherical latent distribution

* Ability to initialize the first embedding layer using pre-trained word embeddings

* Use of HPBandster for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization

* Ability to perform Guided Topic modeling through a novel regularization term
